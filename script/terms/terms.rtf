\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0
\cf0 (a-d collectively, "Usage Data"). Usage Data does not include any of Your software code or sensitive project details. You may change Your preferences disabling the collection of Usage Data and You can audit Usage Data collected by the Editor at any time. See {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://CodeOrbit.dev/docs/telemetry"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 https://CodeOrbit.dev/docs/telemetry}} for more.\
Usage Data is associated with a secure random telemetry ID which may be linked to Your email address. This linkage currently serves two purposes: (1) it allows CodeOrbit to analyze usage patterns over time while maintaining Your privacy; and (2) it enables CodeOrbit to reach out to specific user groups for feedback and improvement suggestions. CodeOrbit may contact You based on Your usage patterns to better understand your needs and improve the Solution. If You delete Your account, the link between Your telemetry ID and Your email address will be permanently removed. By continuing to use Editor or Solution with this feature enabled You agree to this Usage Data collection.\

\pard\pardeftab720\sa240\partightenfactor0

\f0\b0 \cf0 Customer Data consisting of data related to the behavior of the Solution prior to a crash or failure, such as stack traces are collected and classified as "Crash Reports". CodeOrbit will use commercially reasonable efforts to exclude any personally identifiable information from Crash Reports, but due to the nature of a crash, CodeOrbit does not ensure that information such as paths will be excluded from Crash Reports. Crash Reports will be used solely for CodeOrbit's internal purposes in connection with diagnosing defects in the Solution that led to the crash. You may grant us permission to capture Crash Reports when installing or activating the Solution, and You may change Your preferences at any time in the settings feature of the Solution. Once You grant us this permission, CodeOrbit will retain the Crash Reports indefinitely.\

Currently, CodeOrbit does not persist any User Content beyond the Your collaboration session. If You unshare a project or disconnect from the Solution, all information associated with such project will be deleted from CodeOrbit servers. In the future, CodeOrbit may save User Content regarding projects beyond the scope of a single collaboration session. We may share such User Content with those users You elected to grant access to. CodeOrbit's access to such User Content is limited to debugging and making improvements to the Solution.\
