- **Command Palette**: Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` and search for "CodeOrbit"
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: `Ctrl+Shift+O` (configurable in CodeOrbit settings)
- **Context Menu**: Right-click in the editor for context-aware actions

## Configuration

CodeOrbit can be configured via the `config.toml` file. The following options are available:

```toml
[core]
enabled = true
log_level = "info"

[ai]
model = "gpt-4"
max_tokens = 2048
temperature = 0.7

[ui]
show_welcome = true
panel_position = "right"
panel_width = 400
panel_height = 300
```

## Development

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check for clippy warnings
cargo clippy
```

## Prompt Handling Loop

The extension provides a simple round-trip for user prompts. A prompt entered in
the UI is sent to the orchestrator, which forwards it to the `UiPlannerAgent`.
The agent returns a UI component plan and the orchestrator delivers this back to
the prompt panel for display.

Submit a prompt by pressing **Enter** inside the panel's input area or by
clicking the *Send* button. Any agent errors are shown inline.

Main files involved:

- `ui/prompt_panel.rs` â€“ gathers user input and renders responses.
- `core/orchestrator.rs` â€“ routes prompts and manages agents.
- `agents/frontend/ui_planner_agent.rs` â€“ interprets prompts and creates a UI plan.
