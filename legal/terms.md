### 3.3. Customer Data

You are solely responsible for Customer Data including, but not limited to: (a) compliance with all applicable laws and this Agreement; (b) any claims relating to Customer Data; and (c) any claims that Customer Data infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the rights of any third party. You agree and acknowledge that Customer Data may be irretrievably deleted if Your account is terminated. For purposes of this Agreement, "Customer Data" shall mean any data, information or other material provided, uploaded, or submitted by You to the CodeOrbit Service in the course of using the CodeOrbit Service. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, You represent and warrant that You will not transfer or make available to CodeOrbit any personally identifiable information or related information subject to applicable data privacy laws or regulations, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by CodeOrbit.

#### 3.3.1. Customer Data Made Available to CodeOrbit

To the extent You elect to make Customer Data available to CodeOrbit, the same may only be used by CodeOrbit according to the Customer Data type and the use rights regarding the same as described herein:

#### 3.3.2. Usage Data

To improve the Editor and understand how You use it, CodeOrbit optionally collects the following usage data:

- (a) file extensions of opened files;
- (b) features and tools You use within the Editor;
- (c) project statistics (e.g., number of files); and
- (d) frameworks detected in Your projects

(a-d collectively, "Usage Data"). Usage Data does not include any of Your software code or sensitive project details. You may change Your preferences disabling the collection of Usage Data and You can audit Usage Data collected by the Editor at any time. See [https://CodeOrbit.dev/docs/telemetry](https://CodeOrbit.dev/docs/telemetry) for more.

Usage Data is associated with a secure random telemetry ID which may be linked to Your email address. This linkage currently serves two purposes: (1) it allows CodeOrbit to analyze usage patterns over time while maintaining Your privacy; and (2) it enables CodeOrbit to reach out to specific user groups for feedback and improvement suggestions. CodeOrbit may contact You based on Your usage patterns to better understand your needs and improve the Solution. If You delete Your account, the link between Your telemetry ID and Your email address will be permanently removed. By continuing to use Editor or Solution with this feature enabled You agree to this Usage Data collection.

#### 3.3.3. Crash Reports

Customer Data consisting of data related to the behavior of the Solution prior to a crash or failure, such as stack traces are collected and classified as "Crash Reports". CodeOrbit will use commercially reasonable efforts to exclude any personally identifiable information from Crash Reports, but due to the nature of a crash, CodeOrbit does not ensure that information such as paths will be excluded from Crash Reports. Crash Reports will be used solely for CodeOrbit's internal purposes in connection with diagnosing defects in the Solution that led to the crash. You may grant us permission to capture Crash Reports when installing or activating the Solution, and You may change Your preferences at any time in the settings feature of the Solution. Once You grant us this permission, CodeOrbit will retain the Crash Reports indefinitely.

#### 3.3.4. User Content

â€¢ You may access, modify or create certain data or information in connection with your access or use of the CodeOrbit Editor or the Solution. Such data and information may include, but is not limited to any of the following:

- (a) file contents and associated metadata (e.g., filename, paths, size, timestamps);
- (b) source control history, comments and metadata (e.g., git history, commit messages);
- (c) configuration data (e.g., settings, keymaps);
- (d) anything typed, pasted and/or displayed on screen while using the Editor;
- (e) derivative works of the above generated by the Editor (e.g., format conversions, summaries, indexes, caches);
- (f) metadata, code and other derivative works of the above returned by language servers and other local tooling; and
- (g) metadata, code and other derivative works of the above returned by services integrated with the CodeOrbit Editor

(a-g collectively, "User Content").

#### 3.3.5. Handling of User Content

CodeOrbit will make use of or transfer User Content only as specified in this Agreement, or as necessary to comply with applicable law.

#### 3.3.5.1. CodeOrbit Collaboration Services

When using CodeOrbit Collaboration Services, User Content is transmitted from Your environment only if You collaborate with other CodeOrbit users by electing to share a project in the Editor. Once You share a project, CodeOrbit may transmit User Content consisting of file paths, file contents, and metadata regarding the code returned by language servers. Currently, CodeOrbit does not persist any User Content beyond the Your collaboration session. If You unshare a project or disconnect from the Solution, all information associated with such project will be deleted from CodeOrbit servers. In the future, CodeOrbit may save User Content regarding projects beyond the scope of a single collaboration session. We may share such User Content with those users You elected to grant access to. CodeOrbit's access to such User Content is limited to debugging and making improvements to the Solution.

#### 3.3.5.2. Other Services

The CodeOrbit Editor supports integration with API-based services maintained and not operated by CodeOrbit (the "Other Services"). By way of example, Other Services includes those made available by GitHub, Anthropic, OpenAI, and similar providers, or those You host or manage directly. You may configure the CodeOrbit Editor to interoperate, communicate with, and exchange data (including User Content) directly with the Other Services. CodeOrbit is not responsible or otherwise liable with respect to Your use of any Other Service, including but not limited to the exchange of data between the Other Service and the CodeOrbit Editor. The terms and conditions, including the applicable privacy policy, with respect to the Other Service are those made available by the applicable Other Service, not these Terms.

#### 3.3.5.3. CodeOrbit AI Services

The CodeOrbit Editor supports integration with API-based services maintained and operated by CodeOrbit (the "CodeOrbit AI Services"). You may elect to use CodeOrbit AI Services as the provider for various CodeOrbit Editor features (e.g., Agent Panel, Inline Assistant, Edit Predictions, and similar features). In connection with Your use of these features, the CodeOrbit Editor and CodeOrbit AI Services may make use of User Content to generate contextually relevant responses (the â€œOutputâ€). Other than as specified in Section 3.3.5.4 of these Terms, CodeOrbit will not use User Content for training of its models, or disclose User Content.

Output is provided "as is" without any warranties or guarantees of functionality, security, or fitness for a particular purpose. While efforts are made to ensure the accuracy and reliability, Output may include errors, vulnerabilities, and defects. You are responsible for reviewing, testing, and validating Output before use in any production or critical environment. CodeOrbit assumes no liability for any damages, losses, or liability arising from the use, modification, reliance on, or deployment of Output. Any such use is at Your own risk.

#### 3.3.5.4. Improvement Feedback
