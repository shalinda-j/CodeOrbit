# Billing

We use Stripe as our billing and payments provider. All Pro plans require payment via credit card.
For invoice-based billing, a Business plan is required. Contact sales@CodeOrbit.dev for more information.

## Settings {#settings}

You can access billing settings at [CodeOrbit.dev/account](https://CodeOrbit.dev/account).
Clicking the button under Account Settings will navigate you to Stripeâ€™s secure portal, where you can update all billing-related settings and configuration.

## Billing Cycles {#billing-cycles}

CodeOrbit is billed on a monthly basis based on the date you initially subscribe.

Weâ€™ll also bill in-month for additional prompts used beyond your planâ€™s prompt limit, if usage exceeds $20 before month end. See [usage-based pricing](./plans-and-usage.md#ubp) for more.

## Invoice History {#invoice-history}

You can access your invoice history by navigating to [CodeOrbit.dev/account](https://CodeOrbit.dev/account) and clicking "Manage" on your subscription.

From Stripeâ€™s secure portal, you can download all current and historical invoices.

## Updating Billing Information {#updating-billing-info}

You can update your payment method, company name, address, and tax information through the billing portal.

Please note that changes to billing information will **only** affect future invoices â€” **we cannot modify historical invoices**.
